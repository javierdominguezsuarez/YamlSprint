    <h1>Who is behind this?</h1>
    <p>We are Ruben, Francisco, and Javier, computer science students at the ULPGC. We are in our last year of the degree and have a passion for programming. We enjoy solving complex problems and developing efficient, high-quality code. We are dedicated to writing clean code and are proponents of the open-source community. </p>
    <p>Our project is a web application that allows you to follow the Scrum framework. With our application, you can easily manage your software development project by breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable pieces, called user stories, which can be written in YAML format.code and an open-source approach to software development, ensuring that our application is accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
